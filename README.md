        Science, Math, Literary, or History. Once you've picked a category, you'll choose your difficulty level: 
        Easy, Normal, or Expert. The quiz will then begin, displaying questions based on your category and difficulty. 
        Type your answer into the text box and click Submit. Correct answers will earn you points, and answering 
        three consecutive questions correctly will grant you an extra life. Incorrect answers will cost you a life.
